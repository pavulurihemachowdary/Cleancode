The "Novel Recommendation System for Code Validation and Optimal Refactoring" project follows a two-phase methodology to address the limitations of the original Clean CaDET research work.
In the first phase, code smells are detected using static code analysis APIs and programming standards.
This phase implements IDE integration by utilizing static code analysis APIs for programming languages like <b>Python , Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</b> 

In the second phase of the project, the system goes   beyond content selection and actively recommends code snippets and solutions based on the user's context and needs.
Natural language processing techniques were applied to purify and verify the datasets. Libraries such as numpy , scikit-learn, matplotlib, Google Colab 
were instrumental in implementing different methods throughout the project.

The outcome of this project is a novel recommendation system that aids in code validation and optimal refactoring. 
The advantages of this system include its support for multiple programming languages, integration with popular IDEs, and the use of a large dataset to ensure accurate 
and contextually relevant code recommendations. 

The scoring mechanism gives score by comparing the code written by user and the one that is recommended by the system which validates the repective programming languages checks.
